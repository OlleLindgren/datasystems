# datasystems
Library for systematically storing, retrieving and overviewing data

When different packages asyncronously read and write from some set directory, the problem of defining a set hierarchy that all the packages must adhere to arises. The intent of this package is to try to solve that problem in a systematic way, with no additional dependencies beyond the default python3 interpreter.

# install

`pip install git+https://github.com/OlleLindgren/datasystems@v0.4.1`
